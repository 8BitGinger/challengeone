Challenge 1

Description
This is the completed Challenge 1 from Week 1 UTSA Full Stack Developer bootcamp.

Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

Support
contact ryan.fann@gmail.com for support or techinical issues. 

Roadmap
In the future adding a floating chat widget would be a great way to connect with more potential customers!
